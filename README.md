Crypto Portfolio
============
A small simple Crypto Portfolio App on Ruby On Rails
I built the first web app "Crypto Currency Portfolio" on Ruby.
This is based on [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/build-a-crypto-currency-portfolio-app-with-ruby-on-rails/learn/v4/overview).

## Description

I built a Crypto Currency Portfolio app that let's you look up crypto quotes and price information and save it to a database.
<br/><br/>
Users can create an account and sign up to this website, log in, add crypto currencies and coins, check current prices and all kinds of other cool things. 
<br/><br/>
I used [Coinmarketcap.com API](https://coinmarketcap.com/), which provides various data about several listed coins, such as their price, available supply, trade volume over last 24 hours or market capitalization.
I styled the website using the popular Bootstrap CSS framework.
